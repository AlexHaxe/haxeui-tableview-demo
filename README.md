# How to compile

get git version of openfl
get git version of lime
get git version of haxeui-core master branch
get git version of haxeui-openfl master branch

also needs workaround from here: https://github.com/haxeui/haxeui-openfl/issues/35#issuecomment-451964240

run `lime test html5` or `lime test linux` (C++ compilation might not work with Haxe 4)
